Learning to webscrap with Python Beautiful Soup

## What I want to do:
**To update prices and check whether the current sale/discount is the best, comparing it to previous collected data.**

This can be from any websites. 

Wants this as flexible as it can 
else set certain amount of websites.


### Steps:
1. Select a website
2. Select a product to collect data from
3. Highlight the price area so that the program can read it
4. Record and store the price
5. Only update if there's a sale/discount/ change in price
6. Repeat

To not overload resources, delete repeated data

7. Find high and repeated data
8. Remove it
9. Repeat

#### Thoughts/reasonings
Highlighting in terms of finding the position where the price is since different website has different location for the price.
If I can achieve this feature I can make this super flexible to use.


Well that's the idea I need to  learn how to make use the resources for webscraping first.

Then i add and modify it slowly.

## What I've done:
- So far I've made it work with only one website (jb hifi) for personal interest. 
- Made a .bat to run it with multiple sites (in jb hifi) 
- Cleaned up my coding


## Additional functions:
-[] Include images of the product
-[] Maybe make a website to showcase it
-[] Sorting function
-[] Use this to learn more about SQL/database
-[] Work with different website (difficult)

### ---------------------------------------------------------------
## Above is the normal code

## problems:
### 1. Some features would't be found like brand. However, can extract that from the title
## so will need a few functions to find: brand, sale price,
